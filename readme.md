## Pseudo-coding the rules of play

Taken from [The Mechanics of Playing Cribbage (American Cribbage Congress)](http://www.cribbage.org/NewSite/rules/rule1.asp#section5)

### Rule 1.1 Object of the Game

Be the first player to score 121 points

### Rule 1.5 Outline of Playing Sequence

* a) The pack is cut to determine which player will deal first in the first game of a match; the low card wins the deal. Thereafter the loser of the previous game deals first.

* b) The dealer shuffles and, after a mandatory cut by the pone (nondealer), distributes one card alternately to each player, beginning with the pone, until each has six cards.

* c) Each player discards two cards to form the crib, which belongs to the dealer.

* d) The pone cuts the remainder of the pack to select a starter card, which is used in counting the value of each player's hand and the crib.

* e) Play of the cards:

  - (1) 
  Players alternately play (place face up on the table) one card at a time, starting with the pone. The cumulative value of the cards played is announced as each card is played.

  - (2)
  When a player cannot play a card without the cumulative total exceeding 31, that player calls "go", and the opponent continues to play all cards possible (not exceeding a 31-count). The player who calls "go" plays first in the following 31-count sequence.

  - (3)
  Points are scored during this play of the cards (see scoring chart in rule 1.7).

* f) When both players have played all their cards, the pone's hand is counted and pegged by the pone (see scoring chart). The dealer then does the same for the dealer's hand and then for the crib.

* g) The deal alternates between the players until the game ends, which occurs when a player scores 121 points
